usage: mach [global arguments] artifact install [command arguments]

Global Arguments:
  -v, --verbose         Print verbose output.
  -l FILENAME, --log-file FILENAME
                        Filename to write log data to.
  --log-interval        Prefix log line with interval from last message rather than relative time. Note that this is
                        NOT execution time if there are parallel operations.
  --no-interactive      Automatically selects the default option on any interactive prompts. If the output is not a
                        terminal, then --no-interactive is assumed.
