usage: mach [global arguments] repackage subcommand [subcommand arguments]

Repackages artifacts into different formats.

This is generally used after packages are signed by the signing
scriptworkers in order to bundle things up into shippable formats, such as a
.dmg on OSX or an installer exe on Windows.

Global Arguments:
  -v, --verbose         Print verbose output.
  -l FILENAME, --log-file FILENAME
                        Filename to write log data to.
  --log-interval        Prefix log line with interval from last message rather than relative time. Note that this is
                        NOT execution time if there are parallel operations.
  --no-interactive      Automatically selects the default option on any interactive prompts. If the output is not a
                        terminal, then --no-interactive is assumed.
  --log-no-times        Do not prefix log lines with times. By default, mach will prefix each output line with the
                        time since command start.
  -h, --help            Show this help message.
  --debug-command       Start a Python debugger when command is dispatched.
  --profile-command     Capture a Python profile of the mach process as command is dispatched.
  --settings FILENAME   Path to settings file.
