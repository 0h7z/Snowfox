usage: mach [global arguments] clobber [command arguments]

Clean up the source and object directories.

Performing builds and running various commands generate various files.

Sometimes it is necessary to clean up these files in order to make
things work again. This command can be used to perform that cleanup.

The `objdir` target removes most files in the current object directory
(where build output is stored). Some files (like Visual Studio project
files) are not removed by default. If you would like to remove the
object directory in its entirety, run with `--full`.

The `python` target will clean up Python's generated files (virtualenvs,
".pyc", "__pycache__", etc).

The `gradle` target will remove the "gradle" subdirectory of the object
directory.

By default, the command clobbers the `objdir` and `python` targets.

Global Arguments:
  -v, --verbose         Print verbose output.
  -l FILENAME, --log-file FILENAME
                        Filename to write log data to.
  --log-interval        Prefix log line with interval from last message rather than relative time. Note that this is
                        NOT execution time if there are parallel operations.
  --no-interactive      Automatically selects the default option on any interactive prompts. If the output is not a
                        terminal, then --no-interactive is assumed.
  --log-no-times        Do not prefix log lines with times. By default, mach will prefix each output line with the
                        time since command start.
  -h, --help            Show this help message.
  --debug-command       Start a Python debugger when command is dispatched.
  --profile-command     Capture a Python profile of the mach process as command is dispatched.
  --settings FILENAME   Path to settings file.

Command Arguments:
  what    Target to clobber, must be one of {objdir, gradle, python} (default objdir and python).
  --full  Perform a full clobber
