Download, cache and install pre-built toolchains.

Global Arguments:

                        Filename to write log data to.
  --log-interval        Prefix log line with interval from last message rather than relative time. Note that this is
                        NOT execution time if there are parallel operations.
  --no-interactive      Automatically selects the default option on any interactive prompts. If the output is not a

  --from-build BUILD [BUILD ...]
                        Download toolchains resulting from the given build(s); BUILD is a name of a toolchain task,
                        e.g. linux64-clang
  --from-task TASK_ID:ARTIFACT [TASK_ID:ARTIFACT ...]
                        Download toolchain artifact from a given task.
