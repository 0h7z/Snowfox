usage: mach [global arguments] artifact subcommand [subcommand arguments]

Download, cache, and install pre-built binary artifacts to build Firefox.

Use ``mach build`` as normal to freshen your installed binary libraries:
artifact builds automatically download, cache, and install binary
artifacts from Mozilla automation, replacing whatever may be in your
object directory.  Use ``mach artifact last`` to see what binary artifacts
were last used.

Never build libxul again!

Global Arguments:
  -v, --verbose         Print verbose output.
  -l FILENAME, --log-file FILENAME
                        Filename to write log data to.
  --log-interval        Prefix log line with interval from last message rather than relative time. Note that this is
                        NOT execution time if there are parallel operations.
  --no-interactive      Automatically selects the default option on any interactive prompts. If the output is not a
                        terminal, then --no-interactive is assumed.
  --log-no-times        Do not prefix log lines with times. By default, mach will prefix each output line with the
                        time since command start.
  -h, --help            Show this help message.
  --debug-command       Start a Python debugger when command is dispatched.
  --profile-command     Capture a Python profile of the mach process as command is dispatched.
  --settings FILENAME   Path to settings file.

Sub Commands:
  clear-cache           Delete local artifacts and reset local artifact cache.
  install               Install a good pre-built artifact.
